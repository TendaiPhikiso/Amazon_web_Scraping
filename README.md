#### ðŸ“Š Situation: 
 
As part of a personal project to enhance my data skills, I decided to scrape data from the Amazon.co.uk website. The objective was to gather detailed information about data books listed on the site.

---
#### ðŸ“Š Task:  

The goal was to scrape data books on the amazon site, specifically targeting 10 attributes: title, author name, selling price, listsing price, type of book (paperback/hardcover), print length, publication date, rating, review count & availability.

---
#### ðŸ“Š Action:

To accomplish this, I developed a web scraping script using Python. I utilised the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content and the Requests library to handle HTTP requests. The script navigated through the data book listings on Amazon.co.uk, identified the relevant HTML elements, and extracted the desired attributes for each book. I ensured the script handled pagination to collect data from multiple pages.

---
#### ðŸ“Š Results: 
As a result, I successfully extracted a comprehensive dataset consisting of 310 data books from Amazon.co.uk. This dataset is now ready for further transformation and analysis, enabling deeper insights into data book trends and patterns.

###  ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s next? ðŸš€

As part of the ETL process, the extraction phase was a success. Next, the focus shifts to the transformation phase, where the data will be cleaned using python.
